<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Maxwell Ehize Ibhawoh,a 19 year old upcoming web developer. I attend Covenant University and am presently studying Chemical Engineering.
  I hope to be able to build more websites in the future as i venture further into this path.
</p>

<p>I grew up in Benin City Nigeria and am born into a family of 5. My dad, my mum, I , and my wonderful siblings(Ivan and Janice).It is my dream that one day I would be able to work from anywhere in the world at my own comfort as a professional web developer for top companies all over the globe.
  I pray God gives me the grace and focus to make this dream, a reality.
  Special mentions go to my very dear Uncle, Uncle Mike who was a major hit in the tech industry. May his gentle sould RIP ,Amen.
